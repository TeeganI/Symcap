### **Coral color and depth drive symbiosis ecology of Montipora capitata in Kāne'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i**

by **Teegan Innis, Ross Cunning, Raphael Ritson-Williams, Christopher Wall and Ruth Gates**

In this manuscript, we describe the spatial distribution of Symbiodinium among colonies of M. capitata, a dominant coral across Kāne‘ohe Bay, Hawai‘i. We demonstrate a striking depth-distribution, suggesting multiple symbiont types may compete within individual corals with outcomes determined interactively by attributes of the host (color) and the abiotic environment (light).
